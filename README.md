This is a Next.js 13 example using Swell and Coinbase Commerce. It's primarily meant to demonstrate creating a custom payment method and integrating Coinbase Checkout into a headless storefront. While it can be used as a storefront starter kit, not all components are functional beyond those that are covered in the example.

## Getting Started

- Ensure you've signed up for a [Swell](https://swell.store/signup#ph_id=185a794f7f5fd7-0594d5953bdbc8-17525635-4da900-185a794f7f6295f) store
- Sign up for a [Coinbase Commerce](https://www.coinbase.com/commerce#flexible-plans) account
    - sd

Create a `.env.local` file using the `.env.template`

Run `npm install` to install dependencies

You can then run the development server

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
